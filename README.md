# Hack Fortress

Hack Fortress is a cyberpunk social engineering colony sim game, basically Dwarf Fortress meets Kevin Mitnick,
and it features PvP combat, amazing AI, and all kinds of glorious stuff.

Okay, it's not really such a game yet. But hopefully it will be, one day.

HF is built around the idea of **space** in computer games,
and will model, first of all, physical, network and social spaces.

As such an ambitious project will probably never reach its full potential, I decided to pursue a few smaller projects
which will hopefully eventually converge in an interesting computer game. The list is now amounts to:

1. **AI interactive playground** to explore the planning AI based on the A* algorithm, which I want to use in the game.
2. **Cyberpunk tower defense** game to test the AI and have some fun with spaces.

## Can I play it somehow?

Not yet :-(
